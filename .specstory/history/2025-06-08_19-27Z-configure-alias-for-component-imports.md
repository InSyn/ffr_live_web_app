<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating Path Alias Solutions**

I've been thinking about this user's desire for clickable `@` aliases in import paths. It's becoming clearer that they're aiming for path alias configuration, a staple for clean imports in modern JavaScript projects. I'm focusing on the configuration options available, seeking the simplest path to a working solution.


**Analyzing Project Configuration Files**

I'm now investigating the project files. The goal is to determine the configuration options for path aliases. I'm prioritizing `vue.config.js` and `jsconfig.json` files within the `frontend` directory. These are critical for resolving the `@` alias in the build and the IDE, and I'm looking for the configuration that defines path mappings. Identifying these will set the stage for a solution.


**Discovering Key Configuration Files**

I'm now hunting for the specific configuration files. Focusing on `vue.config.js` and `jsconfig.json`, I've mapped out the directory structure. I'm hoping to pinpoint the existing path alias settings or identify how they're being managed. My next move is to closely examine the contents of these files to determine if path alias setup is present. Then, I can focus on implementing a solution for clickable aliases.

Hello! I can certainly help you configure the `@` alias to make your import paths clickable and work correctly in your project. This is a great way to improve project navigation and maintainability.

This usually involves two steps:
1.  Configuring your build tool (likely Vue CLI, in a `vue.config.js` file) so it knows how to resolve these paths when building your application.
2.  Creating a `jsconfig.json` file to provide hints to your editor (like VS Code or Cursor) so it understands the aliases for features like go-to-definition and auto-imports.

I'll start by checking for an existing `vue.config.js` file in your `frontend` directory.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Initial Setup**

I've spotted `vue.config.js` and `jsconfig.json` within the `frontend` directory. Their presence is encouraging. I'm now delving into these files to grasp the extent of existing configurations. Specifically, I'm checking for the anticipated alias setup.


**Assessing Current Configurations**

I'm now investigating `frontend/vue.config.js` and `frontend/jsconfig.json`. The goal is to determine the state of the alias configuration. My initial assessment of `vue.config.js` will reveal the build process's setup. Afterward, I'll turn my attention to `jsconfig.json` to understand editor integration.


</details></think>

Excellent! Both `vue.config.js` and `jsconfig.json` already exist in your `frontend` directory. This means the foundation is likely already there.

I'll now examine the contents of both files to see how they are configured and determine what adjustments are needed. I'll start with `frontend/vue.config.js`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing File Reading**

I made a blunder in my previous attempt. I realize now that I need to specify that I want to read the entire file content, not just parts of it. I'm adjusting my approach, and I'll be reading `frontend/vue.config.js` and `frontend/jsconfig.json` to gather the necessary information.


</details></think>

---

My apologies, I made an error in my previous step. I'll correct that and read the entire contents of `frontend/vue.config.js` and then `frontend/jsconfig.json` to inspect their configurations.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing Aliases in Vue.js**

I've examined the `vue.config.js` file and confirmed that the aliases are already configured as expected within `configureWebpack.resolve.alias`. This seems straightforward, so I'm now exploring other aspects of the setup to ensure everything is functioning correctly. I will proceed by checking the configurations of the files that are using the aliases.


**Inspecting `jsconfig.json`**

I've determined that the build system properly resolves the aliases. My focus has shifted to `jsconfig.json` to investigate why the editor might not recognize them. I am currently examining the content of that file to identify any relevant settings or missing configurations that could be impacting the editor's behavior. The build system confirms the aliases resolve correctly. I will now determine why the editor might not be picking them up.

The `vue.config.js` file is already set up correctly to handle the `@` alias for your build process. This is great news‚Äîit means your project should compile without issues.

The reason the alias isn't clickable in your editor is likely a simple matter of configuring your editor's path intelligence. This is handled by the `jsconfig.json` file.

I'll examine `frontend/jsconfig.json` now to see what's needed.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring Alias Configuration**

I've examined the `vue.config.js` and `jsconfig.json` files within the `frontend` directory. The Webpack alias is configured correctly in `vue.config.js`. I'm now exploring how to make the `@` alias clickable within the editor, leveraging this existing setup. My next step is to investigate the editor's configuration possibilities.


**Debugging `jsconfig.json`**

I've discovered the `jsconfig.json` file in the frontend directory and reviewed its content. Although the initial setup of paths seems correct, I suspect the editor might need a wildcard to resolve the paths fully. My next move is to test this wildcard path addition within the configuration. I'm exploring how to implement this for proper alias resolution.


**Confirming Path Resolution**

I've re-examined the initial configuration, noticing a crucial detail. The `paths` mapping, specifically `"@": ["src"]`, is syntactically correct, however it may hinder the editor's ability to fully resolve paths due to its literal matching. I now propose a wildcard approach with `"@/*": ["src/*"]` to ensure seamless alias navigation within the IDE. I'll test this adjusted mapping to finalize resolution.


**Implementing Wildcard Resolution**

I've carefully examined the `jsconfig.json` and identified the crucial adjustment needed. While the initial setup seemed correct at first glance, the lack of wildcards in the `paths` mapping is hindering the editor's ability to resolve paths effectively. I've formulated a refined configuration incorporating wildcards, like `@/*: ["src/*"]`.  I am preparing to advise the user on making this strategic enhancement. Additionally, I plan to suggest including an 'exclude' array for improved performance.


</details></think>

I've reviewed both your `vue.config.js` and `jsconfig.json` files. Your build configuration (`vue.config.js`) is perfectly fine, but your editor configuration (`jsconfig.json`) needs a small but important adjustment to make the path aliases work for go-to-definition.

The current setup in `jsconfig.json` maps `@` to the `src` directory, but for robust editor support, we should use a wildcard (`/*`) to tell it to resolve any path that *starts with* `@/`. I'll also add a standard `exclude` property to improve editor performance by telling it not to scan `node_modules` or `dist` folders.

Here are the changes for `frontend/jsconfig.json`:

Tool update_file not found.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing the Project Structure**

I've hit a snag. Apparently, the tool I thought I could use doesn't exist. Now, I'm pivoting. I'll provide the updated `frontend/jsconfig.json` as a full code block, instead of a patch. This should address the issue effectively.


**Revising the Solution**

I've realized my previous approach won't work. The tool I thought was available isn't, which necessitates a shift. To circumvent this, I'll supply the complete updated `frontend/jsconfig.json` file as a code block. Afterwards, I'll need to inform the user that restarting their editor might be required for the new configuration to be recognized.

My apologies, I can't directly modify the file. I will instead provide you with the corrected code for `frontend/jsconfig.json`.

As I mentioned, your editor configuration needs a small adjustment to properly resolve those `@` aliases. You need to add wildcards (`/*`) to your path mappings. This tells the editor to match any path that begins with the alias. I'll also add a standard `exclude` property to prevent the editor from getting bogged down scanning irrelevant directories.

Please replace the content of `frontend/jsconfig.json` with the following:

```json:frontend/jsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "src/*"
      ],
      "@components/*": [
        "src/components/*"
      ],
      "@pages/*": [
        "src/pages/*"
      ],
      "@assets/*": [
        "src/assets/*"
      ],
      "@utils/*": [
        "src/utils/*"
      ],
      "@store/*": [
        "src/store/*"
      ]
    }
  },
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist"
  ]
}
```

After you save this change, you may need to restart your editor (Cursor) for it to pick up the new configuration. Once it does, your `@/` import paths should become fully clickable
