## Development Guidelines
Three essential guides created:
1. **DEFINITIVE_MODULE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Mandatory reference for all implementations
2. **OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md** - Day-to-day development workflows
3. **ARCHITECTURAL_CONSISTENCY_GUIDE.md** - System-wide consistency standards

## Current Status
- ✅ Core functionality implemented
- ✅ Authentication system working
- ✅ Database models established
- ✅ File upload system functional
- ⚠️ Testing infrastructure needs improvement
- ⚠️ Documentation needs completion
- ⚠️ Performance monitoring needed

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Implement comprehensive testing, enhance security hardening
2. **Short-term**: Add real-time features, improve mobile experience
3. **Long-term**: Consider microservices migration, native mobile app development
