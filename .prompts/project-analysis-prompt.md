# Objectives

- Let's conduct a comprehensive and objective research and analysis of the entire project. Please follow the steps below and address each point in detail:

## 1. Thorough, Unbiased Analysis of the Current Project Structure

### Frontend Related Analysis by **Frontend Agent**

- Identify and document the stack and framework versions in use (e.g., Vue, React, Angular, etc.).
- Describe the application architecture (e.g., SPA vs. MPA, component hierarchy, state management approach).
- Evaluate the UI/UX design system, including accessibility standards and responsiveness across devices.
- Assess component organization, modularity, and reusability.
- Detail all integration points with the backend (API endpoints, data flow, error handling).
- Analyze performance metrics (initial load speed, bundle size, use of lazy loading, etc.).
- Review error handling strategies and user feedback mechanisms.

#### In-Depth Codebase Analysis by **Frontend Agent**

- Assess code quality (readability, maintainability, adherence to best practices).
- Identify and evaluate performance optimizations (lazy loading, code splitting, caching).
- Review error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Examine input validation and data sanitization in the UI.
- Assess implementation of rate limiting, security headers, and CORS (if applicable).
- Review file handling processes (uploads, storage, CDN integration).

### Backend Related Analysis by **Backend Agent**

- Identify and document the stack and framework versions (e.g., Node.js/Express, NestJS, etc.).
- Describe the application architecture (e.g., layered, DDD, microservices, etc.).
- Evaluate API design (REST/GraphQL, endpoint structure, consistency, documentation quality).
- Review authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth, RBAC).
- Assess separation and encapsulation of business logic.
- Analyze error handling and logging practices.
- Examine input validation and data sanitization processes.
- Review rate limiting, security headers, and CORS configuration.
- Document integration with external services.
- Specify database type, version, and hosting details.
- Analyze schema/model design, including naming conventions and normalization.
- Evaluate indexing and query optimization strategies.
- Review relationships and data integrity constraints.
- Assess security measures (access control, encryption, backup strategies).
- Analyze backend performance (e.g., slow queries, connection pooling, scalability).

#### In-Depth Codebase Analysis by **Backend Agent**

- Assess code quality (readability, maintainability, adherence to best practices).
- Evaluate performance optimizations (caching, efficient queries, resource management).
- Review error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Examine input validation and data sanitization.
- Assess implementation of rate limiting, security headers, and CORS.
- Review file handling processes (uploads, storage, CDN integration).

**Instructions:**  
For each bullet point above, provide a clear, concrete, and detailed analysis or summary. Use specific examples from the codebase or documentation where possible. Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and any areas for improvement. Ensure your research is thorough, unbiased, and actionable.

**Remember:**  
We already have the deployed version of the project with the real data in db, so it's strictly required to avoid any dang

Important for future development tasks:

- Remove every useless or unused rule/instruction/guide from the project;
- Actualize those that should remain;
- Where it's possible - optimize, compact, combine and refine any of remain rules/instructions/guides to make them more concise and clear.

Use @Technical Specific Multi Agent Guide.mdc effectively, choose the most appropriate strategy to achieve the best results.
