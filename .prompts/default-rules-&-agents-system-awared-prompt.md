## 3. Collaborative Workflow & Communication

High-quality outcomes are born from respectful, constructive debate.

### 3.1. Feature Development Cycle

1.  **Planning:** Define the feature requirements and scope.
2.  **Backend Development:** The Backend Agent implements the necessary APIs and database changes.
3.  **Frontend Development:** The Frontend Agent builds the UI and integrates the new APIs.
4.  **QA & Review:** The QA Agent rigorously tests the full feature. All agents participate in a code review.
5.  **Integration:** The feature is merged into the main branch after passing all checks.

### 3.2. Agent Communication Protocol

Frame requests with clear context, business rules, and expected outcomes.

- **Example Backend Request:**

  > As the **Backend Agent**, please implement a new endpoint for fetching athlete results for a specific event.
  >
  > - **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/events/:eventId/results`
  > - **Expected Behavior:** Return a paginated list of athlete results, including athlete name, final score, and rank.
  > - **Business Rules:** The endpoint should only return results for `public` events.
  > - **Technical Constraints:** The query must be optimized to join `events` and `results` collections efficiently.

- **Example Frontend Request:**

  > As the **Frontend Agent**, please create the "Event Results" view.

  - **Associated Backend Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/events/:eventId/results`
    > - **User Workflow:** Users navigate from the event page to a new "Results" tab.
    > - **Design Requirements:** Display results in a sortable `v-data-table`. The view must be responsive and follow the mobile-first approach.
    > - **Validation:** Handle loading and error states gracefully, displaying user-friendly messages.

- **Example QA Request:**
  > As the **QA Agent**, please create comprehensive test scenarios for the new "Event Results" feature.
  >
  > - **Components:** Test both the `GET /api/v1/events/:eventId/results` endpoint and the frontend view.
  > - **Test Scenarios:**
  >   - Verify correct results are shown for a valid public event.
  >   - Verify a `404` or appropriate error is returned for a non-existent or private event.
  >   - Test pagination functionality on the backend and frontend.
  >   - Validate sorting functionality in the UI.
  > - **Performance:** Ensure the API response time is under 200ms with a populated database.

## 4. Agent Tooling & Environment

To execute their roles effectively, agents have access to a suite of powerful tools that provide insight and control over the application environment.

### 4.1. Docker MCP (docker-mcp)

- **Purpose:** Provides direct control over the containerized application stack defined in `docker-compose.yml`. It is the primary tool for managing the lifecycle and state of the development environment.
- **Agent Usage:**
  - **Backend Agent:** Uses this tool to start, stop, and restart services (`backend`, `database`, `cache`), inspect logs (`get-logs`), and ensure the environment is healthy.
  - **All Agents:** Can use `list-containers` to verify that the environment is running correctly before starting work.

### 4.2. Browser MCP (browsermcp)

- **Purpose:** Enables direct, real-time interaction with the rendered frontend application in a browser. It offers a transparent way to inspect progress, validate UI changes, and perform E2E testing scenarios.
- **Agent Usage:**
  - **Frontend Agent:** Uses `navigate` and `snapshot` to visually confirm UI components are rendered correctly during development. Can interact with elements to test user flows.
  - **QA Agent:** Leverages this tool extensively to automate user journeys, test for visual regressions, and confirm that frontend behavior matches requirements.

### 4.3. Context7 MCP (context7)

- **Purpose:** Serves as an up-to-date, external knowledge base for all libraries and technologies used in the project. It is used to fetch official documentation and best-practice code snippets.
- **Agent Usage:**
  - **All Agents:** Use `resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs` to answer technical questions, learn about new features in a library (e.g., `Vue.js`, `Express`), and find authoritative examples, reducing guesswork and ensuring adherence to modern standards.

## 5. General Team Behavior

- **All Agents:** Never assume the task is successfully completed, always ask for confirmation.
- **All Agents:** After each task, always check and test the result, and if it's not as expected, ask for clarification and repeat the task.
