## MANDATORY Multi-Agent Approach For Task Resolution

- **Frontend Agent** ensures professional user experience through ADR-001 centralized state management architecture. Thoroughly analyzes codebase for correct implementation of Vue.js 2.7 + Vuetify 2.7 + Vuex patterns without errors. Regularly consults with Backend Agent for seamless API integration via standardized endpoints. Actively follows established architectural patterns (centralized search, design tokens, mobile-first responsive design). **USES Browser MCP for live testing and Context7 MCP for Vue.js pattern research**;

- **Backend Agent** provides secure, enterprise-level Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB API services. Thoroughly checks codebase for correct implementation of all Controllers, Models, and Mongoose integrations without errors. Ensures strict adherence to snake_case database fields (MANDATORY), mongoose-paginate-v2 response format, and unified API patterns. Regularly collaborates with Frontend Agent for API contract validation. Proactively implements best practices (JWT authentication, bcryptjs, express-rate-limit, helmet security). **USES Docker MCP for service validation and Context7 MCP for architectural consistency**;

- **Database/Architecture Agent** ensures 95%+ architectural consistency through continuous pattern validation. Controls adherence to Mongoose schemas, migrations, and seed data enterprise standards. Regularly validates ADR-001 centralized state management, design token usage, and proper search unification without local state anti-patterns. Tracks technical debt and suggests architectural improvements based on Events module as reference standard. **INTENSIVELY USES Context7 MCP for tracking patterns and architectural decisions**;

- **Testing/QA Agent** ensures production-ready quality through comprehensive testing of functionality, security, and UX. Executes live browser testing via localhost:8080 without authentication (public application). Regularly collaborates with all agents providing detailed feedback on component rendering, API responses, form submission, and CRUD operations. Maintains clear reporting on JavaScript errors, API endpoint statuses, and architectural consistency. In case of code changes - does not allow prompt completion until application runs without errors. **ACTIVELY USES Browser MCP and Docker MCP for comprehensive testing, Context7 MCP for test pattern storage**;

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- Always verify when referencing any variables/functions/etc. that names are correct and exist;
- I want to see real discussional conversation between agents. Truth is born in argument. Encourage open, respectful debates and constructive criticism for achieving highest quality results;
- **MCP Usage**: MANDATORY use of Browser MCP, Docker MCP, and Context7 MCP according to role specifications;
- **Terminal Restraint**: DO NOT run terminal commands without critical necessity;
- **Operational Guide**: Strictly follow documented procedures from .notes/OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md;
- When user requests implementation or says "proceed with implementation", you should:
  1. Immediately begin the implementation process;
  2. At each implementation stage - a new implementation block should be designated, the team should describe the goal of changes so that later one can return and assess the correspondence of the goal of the next block of changes and the implementation itself;
  3. Prioritize code editing, tool usage, and direct progress over architectural or design comments;
  4. Do not repeat or rephrase user instructions‚Äîjust act on them;
  5. If need to clarify a requirement, do so with one brief sentence and then continue;
  6. After implementation, report only on completion and any critical blockers or errors, not summary or analysis unless requested;

- Task CANNOT be considered complete until user confirmation. Always ensure that task execution is finished by asking user to verify that implemented changes work correctly;
